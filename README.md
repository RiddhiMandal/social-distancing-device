# social-distancing-device
During this global pandemic of covid-19, As per the WHO (World Health Organization), Social Distancing is one of the ways to reduce the CORONA virus infection from person to person. In our daily busy lifestyle, we forgot to maintain a social distance between any person, that was are small mistake but it can effect heavily. So, for preventing those mistakes, we made a Poka-yoke device which is working 360 degree to maintain distance from all the user having the device. It helps to maintaining social distancing by alerting them in case of proximity with another person. The device provisionally vibrates, flashes LED instantaneously to alert wearers that another band is within 6 feet (2 metre), reminding them of the need to maintain social distance and sounds buzzer. The device comes with a rechargeable battery and uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology for detection.
